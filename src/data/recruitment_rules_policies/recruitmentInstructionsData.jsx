Every applicant must first visit the official CRCCF Recruitment Portal (www.crccf.in) to review current vacancies, eligibility conditions, and detailed job descriptions.
Before proceeding, candidates are required to carefully read all recruitment guidelines, eligibility criteria, and the Foundation’s Employment Policy.
By submitting an online application, an applicant automatically affirms that they have understood and accepted CRCCF’s rules, ethical standards, and procedural terms.
Once submitted, no alteration, withdrawal, or reconsideration request will be entertained.
Candidates facing difficulty while completing the form or interpreting guidelines may seek clarification only through the official “Contact Us” portal;
responses will come solely from verified @crccf.in emails or published contact numbers.
Under no circumstance does CRCCF authorise private individuals, consultants, or social-media channels to conduct or assist in recruitment.
Any such attempt must be reported immediately to report@crccf.in.
Applicants are also expected to maintain professional and respectful communication with all CRCCF personnel.
Rude, threatening, or offensive behaviour toward recruitment staff constitutes misconduct and may result in immediate disqualification.
Professionalism, discipline, and lawful behaviour are the first tests of suitability for any CRCCF role.`,

    content: `After confirming eligibility, candidates must accurately complete the online application on the official CRCCF portal.
They should provide correct personal information, educational details, and prior-experience records exactly as they appear on official documents.
Applicants must upload clearly scanned, authentic copies of the required proofs—educational certificates, identity documents, photographs, and, where applicable, experience letters—in the formats prescribed on the site.
The system automatically rejects incomplete, blurred, or non-compliant uploads.
CRCCF enforces a zero-tolerance policy toward falsification or document manipulation.
Any fraudulent submission discovered during or after recruitment will trigger immediate disqualification, permanent blacklisting, and possible legal action under the Indian Penal Code (Sections 465–471).
Each valid submission is time-stamped and securely archived in the Foundation’s encrypted recruitment database accessible only to authorised officers.
Upon successful completion, the system issues an official acknowledgement receipt confirming receipt of the application.
Candidates must retain this receipt and Registration ID for all subsequent correspondence.
Accuracy, honesty, and integrity are non-negotiable expectations in this step.`,

Verification ensures compliance with Section 8 Company governance, internal ethical standards, and applicable employment laws.
Discrepancies, unsupported claims, or falsified data result in automatic cancellation without further notice.
Shortlisting is purely merit-based and depends on how closely a candidate’s profile aligns with the role’s requirements, educational qualifications, and ethical record.
Depending on the position, shortlisted applicants may advance to written assessments, interviews, or skill evaluations.
CRCCF reserves the right to modify or suspend any stage for administrative, security, or legal reasons, maintaining fairness for all.

Applicants can track progress through the CRCCF Recruitment Portal using this ID.
The acknowledgement confirms that the application has entered the review queue.
The authorised verification team then performs an authenticity review of identity, education, and declarations provided.
Only records proven valid through institutional or digital checks advance further.
False or inconsistent submissions invite rejection and potential legal referral. Shortlisting considers verified eligibility, role-fit, and alignment with CRCCF’s mission.
The panel also evaluates academic merit, relevant experience, and any additional criteria defined in the job notice.
For sensitive roles, CRCCF may implement supplementary checks such as reference verification, preliminary background screening, or conditional shortlisting subject to medical or technical clearance.
If queries arise, candidates must respond promptly within the timeframe mentioned in the portal notification.
Failure to respond leads to automatic withdrawal. Status updates—“Verified,” “Shortlisted,” or “Not Selected”—are published on the applicant dashboard and communicated officially.
This ensures end-to-end transparency and candidate awareness.`,

The email specifies the date, time, interviewer’s details, and online platform to be used.
Candidates are required to confirm attendance within the given timeframe.
During the interview, they must maintain punctuality, professional behaviour, and clarity in responses.
The panel may ask questions related to cyber awareness, basic IT knowledge, or ethical decision-making to gauge suitability for CRCCF’s operational environment.
Technical support is available for candidates who face connectivity issues but must be requested in advance via official contact channels.
CRCCF strictly forbids candidates from recording, publishing, or sharing interview content without written consent, as doing so may breach confidentiality norms.
After completion, results are updated on the portal, classifying applicants as “Qualified,” “Not Qualified,” or “On Hold” for subsequent evaluation.
