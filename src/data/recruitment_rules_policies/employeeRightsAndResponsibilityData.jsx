    content: `The Employee Rights & Responsibilities Policy of CR Cyber Crime Foundation (CRCCF) establishes a structured framework that protects the interests of both the organisation and every individual associated with it.
The purpose of this policy is to ensure lawful employment, ethical behaviour, mutual respect, and a positive workplace culture that reflects CRCCF’s values of transparency, service, and accountability.
As a registered Section 8 Company, CRCCF operates as a not-for-profit legal and digital awareness organisation.
It is governed by the principles of lawful employment, equality, and civic responsibility.
Therefore, this policy serves as a guiding document for all employees, interns, and volunteers who contribute to CRCCF’s mission of building a secure and digitally aware nation.
This document outlines not only the rights employees are entitled to but also the responsibilities they must uphold.
It aims to balance organisational authority with employee empowerment — ensuring that every individual works with dignity, discipline, and fairness.
Through this policy, CRCCF reaffirms its commitment to a professional environment that supports lawful conduct, encourages learning, and respects human values in every engagement.`,

Every team member, regardless of hierarchy, is bound by these guidelines equally.
CRCCF ensures that every employee understands this policy upon joining the organisation.
A copy of the Employee Rights & Responsibilities framework is provided during orientation and remains accessible through the official HR or recruitment portal.
In the case of partnerships, outsourced services, or project collaborations, external professionals working under CRCCF supervision are also expected to adhere to these standards to maintain organisational consistency and compliance.
By defining scope and applicability clearly, CRCCF promotes collective accountability while ensuring that every role — from intern to director — upholds the same standards of ethics, discipline, and legal compliance.`,

Sharing, duplicating, or disclosing such data to unauthorised individuals is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary or legal action under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and Official Secrets Act, 1923 (where applicable).
CRCCF also emphasises digital information security. Employees must log out of systems after use, protect login credentials, and immediately report any suspected data breach.
