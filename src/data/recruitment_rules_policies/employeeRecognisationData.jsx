    content: `The Employee Recognition & Awards Policy of CR Cyber Crime Foundation (CRCCF) is established to honour, encourage, and sustain a culture of excellence, dedication, and integrity among all employees, interns, and volunteers.
Recognition serves not merely as a reward for performance but as an affirmation of ethical service, teamwork, and civic contribution within CRCCF’s national mission of cyber awareness and digital safety.
The purpose of this policy is to celebrate individuals and teams who demonstrate exceptional professionalism, creativity, and social impact through their roles.
It promotes the idea that service and responsibility are as valuable as innovation and achievement.
CRCCF believes that a transparent recognition system motivates employees to uphold the highest standards of conduct and performance.
By linking acknowledgment to merit, discipline, and lawful conduct, the Foundation ensures that recognition remains both aspirational and credible.
This policy supports employee morale, retention, and personal development while reinforcing CRCCF’s institutional commitment to social accountability and ethical awareness.
Every award presented under this framework symbolises not just success, but service to the nation’s digital well-being.`,

    id: 'sec3-principles-of-recognition',
    heading: 'Principles of Recognition',
    content: `CRCCF’s approach to recognition is guided by three foundational principles — fairness, transparency, and ethical validation.

Fairness: Every employee or participant is evaluated solely on objective performance data and behavioural integrity.
Favouritism, bias, or undue influence in recognition is strictly prohibited.

Transparency: All nominations, evaluations, and decisions are documented, traceable, and communicated through official channels.

Ethical Validation: No recognition will be granted to individuals who have violated any part of the CRCCF Code of Conduct or are under disciplinary review.

Awards serve to promote a positive work environment, not competition or hierarchy.
Therefore, CRCCF emphasises collective growth and team collaboration rather than isolated performance alone.
This principle-based system ensures that recognition represents genuine contribution to CRCCF’s objectives and social mission.
Each award thus stands as a moral and professional milestone that inspires others to emulate integrity and service excellence.`,
