    content: `The CR Cyber Crime Foundation (CRCCF) firmly believes that education and training are the most powerful instruments to build a safe and responsible digital nation.
Our training and orientation initiatives are designed to translate knowledge into national service—helping individuals become capable defenders of digital integrity.
The purpose of this program is to ensure that every person associated with CRCCF, whether as an employee, intern, or volunteer, possesses the technical ability, ethical awareness, and civic discipline needed to uphold India’s cyber laws and values.
CRCCF’s training vision is two-fold: (1) to empower individuals through structured learning that bridges theoretical understanding with real-world application, and (2) to cultivate a culture of ethical technology use and lawful digital behaviour.
All training modules are created in alignment with the Companies Act (2013), the Information Technology Act (2000), and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023).
By combining legal knowledge, technical skill, and social responsibility, CRCCF ensures that learning is not confined to classrooms but reflected in every action of its members.`,

    content: `The training and skill-development framework applies uniformly to all categories of engagement within CRCCF.
This includes full-time and part-time employees, interns, project trainees, volunteers, and contractual collaborators.
Each participant undergoes orientation and continuous learning appropriate to their role, ensuring a unified standard of performance, ethics, and legal compliance across the organisation.
Training extends to multiple layers: administrative, technical, legal, and public-engagement divisions.
While employees receive role-specific professional development, interns and volunteers are oriented toward awareness campaigns, research, and public education.
Partner institutions and collaborating bodies are also invited to participate in certain modules to promote coordinated digital awareness at the national level.
By defining this broad scope, CRCCF ensures that no one associated with the Foundation remains uninformed about its mission, responsibilities, or ethical obligations.
Every learner becomes an ambassador of lawful and safe digital practice.`,
