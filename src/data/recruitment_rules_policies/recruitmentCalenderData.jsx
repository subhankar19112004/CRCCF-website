It is designed to uphold equal opportunity, clarity, and accountability in workforce planning.
Each year’s recruitment cycle is aligned with CRCCF’s project requirements, budgetary provisions, and compliance obligations under the Companies Act (2013) and the Information Technology Act (2000).
By maintaining a consistent and public timeline, CRCCF ensures that candidates can plan, prepare, and participate responsibly in the selection process.

Quarter 1 (January–March): Planning and forecasting of annual manpower and internship requirements.

Quarter 2 (April–June): Announcement of vacancies, opening of applications, and screening processes.

Quarter 3 (July–September): Examinations, interviews, and selection assessments for most positions.

Quarter 4 (October–December): Final appointments, onboarding, and induction training programs.

Each quarter concludes with a review of completed activities, pending applications, and future needs.
The calendar remains flexible enough to accommodate special recruitment drives based on national cyber awareness campaigns or urgent operational mandates.
Updates and revisions are published promptly on CRCCF’s official portal and social-media handles.
This predictable yet adaptive model allows the organisation to meet its staffing needs efficiently while remaining responsive to evolving project priorities.`,
