The Code of Conduct & Professional Ethics has been established to define the behavioural and moral expectations of every member, ensuring that CRCCF’s actions remain aligned with its legal responsibilities and social mission.
This code applies not only to work activities but also to the manner in which individuals represent the organisation in public, digital, and professional spaces.
The purpose of this Code is to create a structured ethical culture based on transparency, fairness, accountability, and respect for human rights.
It ensures that no member acts in a way that harms the Foundation’s image, breaches confidentiality, or violates Indian law.
As a registered Section 8 Company, CRCCF upholds legal compliance with the Companies Act (2013), Information Technology Act (2000), and Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023), making adherence to this Code a binding professional duty.
The Code serves as both a guideline and a commitment — guiding daily actions, protecting organizational integrity, and ensuring that every employee, intern, or volunteer contributes positively to CRCCF’s mission of promoting cyber awareness, education, and lawful digital behaviour.`,

Digital behaviour: Responsible use of online platforms, data, and IT infrastructure.

Confidentiality and privacy: Proper handling of all sensitive or internal information.

Contractors, vendors, and external associates working under CRCCF’s name must also comply with the same ethical standards.
This ensures consistency, accountability, and uniform ethical behaviour across all levels of the organisation.`,
