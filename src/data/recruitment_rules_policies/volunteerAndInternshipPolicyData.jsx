    content: `The Volunteer & Internship Policy of CR Cyber Crime Foundation (CRCCF) defines the ethical, educational, and operational framework for all individuals engaged as volunteers, interns, or social contributors. As a registered Section 8 organisation, CRCCF functions in the public interest — creating awareness about cybercrime, promoting digital ethics, and supporting lawful digital transformation across India.
The purpose of this policy is to provide a structured pathway for students, professionals, and civic-minded individuals to gain meaningful exposure to cyber awareness, IT law, and community service. It ensures that participation under CRCCF is lawful, transparent, and beneficial to both the individual and society.
CRCCF believes that volunteerism and internships are not mere temporary engagements but a civic responsibility — an opportunity to contribute to India’s national digital safety mission. Every participant becomes a representative of lawful digital citizenship and ethical conduct.
By aligning with CRCCF’s mission, interns and volunteers not only enhance their professional skills but also develop civic discipline, teamwork, and social accountability — making this initiative a bridge between education and real-world social impact.`,

    content: `To ensure that each participant gains both practical and ethical knowledge, CRCCF provides structured training and continuous supervision throughout the engagement period.
All interns and volunteers undergo an orientation session introducing them to the organisation’s mission, policies, data privacy rules, and reporting mechanisms. They are then assigned to a department or project under a designated mentor or supervisor who provides day-to-day guidance and evaluates their progress.
Mentorship includes exposure to real-world case studies, awareness events, documentation work, and lawful digital operations. Regular team meetings, workshops, and evaluation sessions help participants understand the link between technical expertise, social responsibility, and legal compliance.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all participants maintain decorum, adhere to deadlines, and comply with CRCCF’s Code of Conduct. Participants are encouraged to seek clarification, share learning experiences, and report any difficulties through proper channels.
