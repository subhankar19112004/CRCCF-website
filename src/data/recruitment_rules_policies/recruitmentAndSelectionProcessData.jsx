Before proceeding, candidates are required to carefully read all recruitment guidelines, eligibility criteria, and the Foundation’s Employment Policy.
By submitting an online application, an applicant automatically affirms that they have understood and accepted CRCCF’s rules, ethical standards, and procedural terms.
Once submitted, no alteration, withdrawal, or reconsideration request will be entertained.
Candidates facing difficulty while completing the form or interpreting guidelines may seek clarification only through the official “Contact Us” portal;
responses will come solely from verified @crccf.in emails or published contact numbers.
Under no circumstance does CRCCF authorise private individuals, consultants, or social-media channels to conduct or assist in recruitment.
Any such attempt must be reported immediately to report@crccf.in.
Applicants are also expected to maintain professional and respectful communication with all CRCCF personnel.
Rude, threatening, or offensive behaviour toward recruitment staff constitutes misconduct and may result in immediate disqualification.
